# Changelog

## 0.3.0 - TBD

### Changes

- Vector Database backend now uses OpenSearch instead of Milvus. This will give us many more options with managing metadata from the ingested documents as well as strong RBAC features.
- `install.py` should be a little more intuitive to use now.

### Added

- `delete_index` command
- `documents` command
- `list_indices` command

## 0.2.0 - 2024-05-15

### Changes

- Web GUI ported from Streamlit to Shiny for Python: we have found Shiny to be much more robust, especially with handling long tasks such as ingesting documents.
- `launch.py` and `install.py` improved to (hopefully) work on more Operating Systems.

### Added

- Theme selector for Web GUI

## 0.1.3 - 2024-03-14

### Added

- `launch.py` script to make starting Concierge simpler.
